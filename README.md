# build-rpm-packages

Shell script build-rpm-packages
- reads a text file containing rpm packages to install,
- summarizes the entire installation process, and
- generates detailed log files 

Benefits
- lets you keep an ongoing alphabetical (highly recommended) list of useful rpm packages you can't live without
- installs each rpm package, one at a time... that way if a particular application is having issues, it doesn't hold up the rest
- handy error log lets you get right to the problem packages
- provides a very easy way to rebuild your application base on a brand new build... just start it, watch some tv, check it later
- keeps logs of previous installation attempts
